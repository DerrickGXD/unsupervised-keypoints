# Unsupervised Learning of Keypoints Detection in Images and Videos With More Complex Backgrounds
Inspired by Jakab and Gupta et al. (2018) [Unsupervised Learning of Object Landmarks through Conditional Image Generation](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/unsupervised_landmarks/unsupervised_landmarks.pdf) and Kulkarni and Gupta et al. (2019) [Unsupervised Learning of Object Keypoints for Perception and Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11883.pdf), the objective of this dissertation is to produce a unsupervised learning model detecting keypoints of images or frames in videos. The approach of learning is similar from the two papers, through creating two models and pairs of source and target image. The first model trains to detect geometry of object from the source image while the second model trains to reconstruct source image via combination of source image and geometry of object. Aside from reimplementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models from the Jakab and Gupta's papers, this dissertation aims to explore the capability of model on keypoints detection with more complex background. Hence, the [TigDog Dataset](http://calvin-vision.net/datasets/tigdog/) is used during training and testing process.
